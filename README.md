# Type-N-Speak
> Type-n-speak is a text-to-speech application made using vanilla JS and Web Speech API. It utilizes no third party libraries and uses Bootstrap for the UI. I used this application as a way to practice JS fundamentals and more advanced projects as well as incorporating a CSS framework without using a React app. Please see `Installation Instructions` for more details on the application. 

- **Note:** Application uses the feature for Synthesis and is supported on Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari(WebKit).
- **Note:** Web Speech API is experimental and may not fully work in some versions of certain browsers

### Features: 
1. Text-to-speech rendering (with animations when speaking is active).
2. Different languages and accents available. 
3. Ability to change rate and pitch of the API response. 
4. Mobile Responsive
